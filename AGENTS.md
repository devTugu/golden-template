# Agent instructions

Coding rules live in `.cursor/rules/`. Start with `CLAUDE.md` for the rule index and commands. Product docs: `md/README.md`.

Do not follow outdated TypeORM / mega-`.cursorrules` tutorials — this backend uses **Drizzle** + Clean Architecture; frontend uses **FSD + BFF**.

Backend Jest (unit + e2e): workspace imports (`@default/utils/*`, `@default/types/*`) need matching `moduleNameMapper` in `backend/package.json` and `backend/test/jest-e2e.json` — see `md/quality.md`.

New domains: `md/fork.md` and `pnpm generate:domain -- --name <kebab-case>`. Before push: `pnpm verify` (includes `pnpm check:hygiene` and `pnpm test:scripts`).

Shared packages use the `@default/*` scope. Client data: `@default/types` → `@default/api` → `@default/hooks` → UI.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
